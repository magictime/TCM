TCM thinks a person with spleen/stomach (digestive system) deficiency and coldness could be due to: bad eating habits, such as having no control on eating, frequent eating cold/icy food/drink.  Plus fast pace life style, sleep deficiency; excess work and mental stress all contribute to it.

What one needs is : regular meal schedule and fixed amount of foods, not stay up late, relax self, and eat the proper foods.

What is “proper foods”?  It’s the foods that suitable to one’s body property.

People with weak and cold spleen/stomach, which represent digestive system, has “deficiency” and “coldness” so he needs to “warm the digestive system and expel coldness”.  Therefore eating more “warm/hot” type of foods is like delivering coal in snowy days; eating less cold/cool type of foods will not worsen the situation.

“warm/hot” type of foods include: lamb, chicken, pork, fish, cinnamon, dry ginger, raw ginger, pepper, cumin, brown sugar etc.

Remember: there is no “good” or “bad”foods but “suitable” or “not suitable ”to one’s body property.
The foods that are beneficial to weak and cold body property are lamb, which is not suitable for hot type of body property.

The foods that are beneficial to hot body property are like watermelon, which is not suitable for cold body property.
