    1.  There is no "good" or "bad" foods.  Only foods that's suitable for you or not </a>
  <div id="story1" class="collapse">
    <p>David is working for a truck company delivering goods under hot sun.  
      He also stays up late at night. One night he had a dinner with friends and drank some liquor.  
      The next morning, his gum hurts. An old lady in the company told him that this is called "fire up".  
      Go buy and drink some coconut water (has cooling property) will fix this problem.</p>
      <p> David followed her direction and the pain in gum disappeared. </p>
<p> A few days later, David's girlfriend Jane worked extra hours at work and did not sleep well.  
  Her gum hurt too.  Upon knowing this, David went to buy coconut water for her to drink. 
  After drinking it, the pain from gum did not stop and became worse, plus some old wound flared up 
  and she could not sleep at night due to lower back pain. The amount of her discharge also increased. </p>

<p>Why is there such a difference and what's the problem?</p>
<p> The answer resides on "excess fire vs. deficient fire", "male vs. female" and "physical labor vs. mental work"</p>
 <ul>   
<li> David has excess fire.  Jane has deficient fire.</li>
<li>David is male.  Jane is female.</li>
<li> David's work is physical.  Jane's work is mental.</li>
 </ul>   
<p>So, there is no "good" or "bad" food.   There is "suitable" or "unsuitable" food for a person's body type.</p>
    
<p>One who has "excess fire" can drink coconut water, which has cooling effect. 
One who has deficient fire, the "fire (gum hurts) is a false appearance.  The deficiency (in fire) is the  truth.
Since she is deficient in fire, drinking the cooling property coconut water will cause her fire even deficient. 
(Therefore causing even more trouble and won't fix the original problem)</p>
